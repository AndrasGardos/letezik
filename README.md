In this game, you have to tell apart real hungarian settlements from fake ones. 

I've generated the fakes settlements using [textgenrnn].(https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn)
Can you tell the real and the fake settlements apart?

#TODO:
[ ] refactor the code
[ ] change the design
[ ] social links and meta descriptions
[ ] add statistics (google analytics with events?)
